# 0001 - Record architecture decisions

Date: 2025-10-03

## Status
Accepted

## Context
We are redesigning the project to improve reliability, modularity, and deployment on Vercel + Postgres (Neon). We need a consistent way to document decisions and rationale.

## Decision
Adopt Architecture Decision Records (ADRs) following a simple template per decision in `docs/adr/`.

## Consequences
- Clear history of why changes were made
- Easier onboarding and audits
- Lightweight process: add a file per decision
