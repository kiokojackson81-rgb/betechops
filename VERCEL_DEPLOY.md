Deployment checklist for Vercel

This project uses Next.js (App Router), NextAuth, and Prisma.

Before you deploy on Vercel

1) Environment variables (set in Vercel Project > Settings > Environment Variables):
   - DATABASE_URL  — A connection string to your production database. For Vercel you should use a hosted Postgres (recommended) or Planetscale. Example: `postgresql://USER:PASSWORD@HOST:5432/dbname?schema=public`
   - NEXTAUTH_SECRET — A long random string for NextAuth session encryption.
   - NEXTAUTH_URL — Your site URL e.g. `https://your-app.vercel.app`
   - GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID and GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET — If you use Google SSO (NextAuth) for auth.
   - Any other API keys used by your app (e.g. JUMIA credentials) as `SHOP_API_KEY` etc.

Important note about SQLite

- This repo is configured for Postgres in production. Ensure `DATABASE_URL` uses a `postgresql://` scheme.
- Local SQLite is no longer used by default; any `dev.db` is ignored. Use a local Postgres if you want dev parity.

Database migrations and seeding

- Primary CI runs `npx prisma migrate deploy` before deploying (see `.github/workflows/prisma-and-vercel.yml`).
- A lightweight migration-only pipeline exists at `.github/workflows/prisma-migrate.yml` to just apply migrations using `DATABASE_URL`.
- Locally or one-off in CI, you can run:
   - `npm run prisma:generate` (or `npx prisma generate`)
   - `npm run prisma:migrate` (alias of `prisma migrate deploy`)
- If you need to seed data, run `node prisma/seed.js` once against the production DB (be careful not to overwrite production data).

Recommended workflow

1. Provision a hosted Postgres DB and set the `DATABASE_URL` secret in Vercel.
2. In your CI (or a one-off job), run:
   - `npx prisma generate`
   - `npx prisma migrate deploy`
   - optionally `node prisma/seed.js` (if you need initial data)
3. Deploy the Next.js app to Vercel. The `postinstall` script runs `prisma generate` on install.

Cron jobs (sync + cleanup)

- This repo defines Vercel Cron Jobs in `vercel.json`.
   - Incremental Jumia orders sync runs every 5 minutes: `POST /api/jumia/jobs/sync-incremental`
   - You can adjust schedules in `vercel.json` or Vercel dashboard under Project > Settings > Cron Jobs.
- To periodically purge old orders (>60 days), a GitHub Actions workflow is provided:
   - `.github/workflows/nightly-cleanup.yml` runs daily at 02:00 UTC
   - Requires the following repository secrets:
      - `DATABASE_URL` (required)
      - `DIRECT_URL` (optional; falls back to `DATABASE_URL` if not set)
      - `JUMIA_ORDERS_RETENTION_DAYS` (optional; defaults to 60)
   - You can also run locally or from another scheduler: `npm run cleanup:jumia-orders`

Jumia configuration

- You can configure Jumia OIDC/API either via env vars (JUMIA_*) or via the API:
   - GET/POST `/api/settings/jumia` stores credentials in `ApiCredential(scope="GLOBAL")`.
   - Diagnostics: `/api/debug/oidc?test=true` to verify refresh-token exchange.

Troubleshooting

- If you see runtime errors about `prisma` or `prisma client`, ensure `prisma generate` ran successfully and `DATABASE_URL` is set.
- If your NextAuth sessions are missing roles or user data, verify `NEXTAUTH_SECRET` and the Google client secrets are set.

If you want, I can:
- Add a GitHub Actions workflow to run migrations before (or during) Vercel deployments.
- Help provision a managed Postgres and update the `.env` + migration pipeline.
